# EQ Presets

A set of presets for my personal In-Ear Monitors (IEMs) collection. Do
note that all presets are tuned to my personal preferences which are
also influenced by head-related transfer function. Hence, they are not
intended to be used as is by a different person.

A rough target based on my preferences would be the IEF 2025 target but
with slightly less bass, less ear gain, a mid-bass boost around 150 Hz
and an upper treble cut around 10 kHz. For measurements taken with the
B&K 5128 HATS, the following preference adjustments are applicable to
the JM-1 Diffuse Field target.
- Tilt 0dB/octave
- Bass +7.2dB
- Treble -4dB
- Ear Gain -2dB

In my experience, the preference adjustments can vary depending on the
response of the drivers. For example, treble peaks can appear to be
more tolerable with electrostatic tweeters compared to some balanced
armatures. Note that this is a subjective take based on impression from
just one pair of IEMs (Monarch Mk3) and no measurements to back it up.
In such cases, the treble adjustment can be increased by up to 1.5 dB.
The additional presence and air can improve the sense of clarity and
stage width.

# EQ Presets

A set of presets for my personal In-Ear Monitors (IEMs) collection. Do
note that all presets are tuned to my personal preferences which are
also influenced by head-related transfer function. Hence, they are not
intended to be used as is.

A rough target based on my preferences would be something close the IEF
2025 target but with less ear gain and a slight mid-bass boost around
160 Hz and a slight dip around 10 kHz. For measurements taken with the
B&K 5128, a JM-1 Diffuse Field based target based needs the following
preference adjustments.
- Tilt 0dB/octave
- Bass +8dB
- Treble -4dB
- Ear Gain -2.4dB

The preference adjustments can vary depending on the response of the
drivers. For example, treble peaks may appear to be more tolerable with
electrostatic tweeters than balanced armatures. Do note that this is a
subjective take based on experience with just one pair of IEMs (Monarch
Mk3) and no measurements to back it up. In such cases, the treble
adjustment can be increased by up to 1.5 dB. The additional presence
and air can improve clarity and staging.

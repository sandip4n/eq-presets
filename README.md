# EQ Presets

A set of parametric equalizer presets for [IEMs](https://headphones.com/blogs/features/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-iems-everything-you-need-to-know-in-less-than-10-minutes).
Do note that all presets are tuned to my personal preferences. Owing to
differences in [HRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function),
these presets are not intended to be used as is by another person.

## Preferences

The target used here is a variation of the [IEF](https://crinacle.com/2021/06/04/the-tonal-technical-dichotomy-the-ief-evaluation-system)
[2025 target](https://crinacle.com/2025/02/05/the-new-2025-ief-target/)
with less sub-bass, less ear gain, a mid-bass boost around 150 Hz and
an upper treble cut around 10 kHz. For measurements taken with the
[B&K 5128](https://www.hbkworld.com/en/products/electroacoustics/head-and-torso-simulators-hats/high-frequency-head-and-torso-simulator-5128-c)
and compared against the [JM-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZoKPtzjdtQ)
diffuse field curve, the following preference adjustments are applicable.
- Tilt 0dB/octave
- Bass +7.2dB
- Treble -4dB
- Ear Gain -2dB

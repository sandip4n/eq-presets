# EQ Presets

A set of parametric equalizer presets for [IEMs][1]. Do note that all presets
are tuned to my personal preferences. Owing to differences in [HRTF][2], these
presets are not intended to be used as is by another person.

## Preferences

The target used here is a variation of the [IEF][3] [2025 target][4] with
less sub-bass, less ear gain and an upper treble cut around 10 kHz. For
measurements taken with the [B&K 5128][5] and compared against the [JM-1][6]
diffuse field, the following preference adjustments are applicable.
- Tilt 0dB/octave
- Bass +7.2dB
- Treble -4dB
- Ear Gain -2dB
